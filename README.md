## About Me

I'm a software engineer based in India who builds developer tools and AI-powered products. My CLI tool [**git-scope**](https://github.com/Bharath-code/git-scope) — written in Go — helps developers manage 50+ repositories from a single TUI with <10ms launch time, and has 6 contributors and 15 releases on Homebrew and npm.

I integrate LLMs (Gemini, ElevenLabs) into production apps with real-time voice, structured output, and end-to-end TypeScript. I write about my work on [Medium](https://medium.com/@kumarbharath63) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/iam_pbk).
